# RAS algorithm and Entropy models for Matrix Balancing


This model implements three different approaches to solving an Entropy based Maxtrix Balancing Problem:

1. RAS algorithm
2. Entropy model as NLP
3. Entropy model as conic problem (exponential cone)

We solve the NLP model with different solvers.
