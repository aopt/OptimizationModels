Solution      = 1.2E-5  best solution found during preprocessing
Best possible = 1.2E-5
Absolute gap  = 1.6940658945086E-21  optca = 1E-9
Relative gap  = 1.41172157875717E-16  optcr = 0.0001
  (Note that BARON uses a different formula to compute the relative gap as
   was used for the above reported value.)
