# Enumerate all optimal solutions for the Queens problem

Place as many queens as possible on the chessboard so that none of the pieces attack another one. 

This model illustrates:
  -  Using the Cplex solution pool
  -  A tolerance problem with the Cplex solution pool
  -  Generating HTML/SVG to visualize all 92 solutions
